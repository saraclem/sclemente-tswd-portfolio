# Outline
> ### High-level summary:
> #### Pretty pink flowers can be a powerful reminder about unity, peace, and mortality.
> Cherry blossom trees are typically 15-30 feet, live approximately 30 years, and are best known for their annual pink and white blooms. Native to Japan, cherry blossoms, called Sakura, are the national flower, and hold many meanings. They symbolize the dichotomy of the beauty of life and mortality--"As the coming of spring promises new life, so the blooming of cherry blossoms brings a sense of vitality and vibrancy. At the same time, their short lifespan is a reminder that life is fleeting" (Guide to Japan, 2025). Cherry blossom rituals in Japan can be traced back to Samurai warriors, and continue today.
>
> Washington, D.C. is also known for its abundance of cherry blossom trees, originally planted in the early 1900s. The idea to bring cherry blossoms to D.C. was introduced by a world traveler, Mrs. Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, after a trip to Japan. After decades of peristance, in 1909, a letter Eliza wrote to first lady Helen Herron Taft finally led to action. Mrs. Taft had visited Japan and knew of the beauty of cherry trees, and took up the project. After hearing of her plans to plant trees along the avenue of the potomac, the Japanese consul offered a donation of an additional 2,000 trees given in the name of the City of Toyko. In 1912, after an unfortunate mishap with the first shipment of trees, a second shipment of 3,020 from 12 varieties arrived in Seattle from Japan. The trees were planted around the Tidal Basin. The took 7 years!
> 
> Not long after the first cherry blossom trees donated by Japan were planted, relations between the two countries became contentious. Still the trees lived on. Following WWII, Japan continued to donate trees as a symbol of ongoing diplomacy.
>
> Today, cherry blossom season is still one of the most significant periods of tourism each year, both in Japan and in Washington D.C. In D.C. they draw over a million visitors each year, and are one of the most distinguishing features of the city. Each spring, the cherry blossom festival offers community events and celebrations around the city. There is a strong local community surrounding cherry blossoms as well. Last year, the removal of one tree, lovingly called 'Stumpy' gave rise to protests and city-wide mourning.
>
> For those looking for beauty in every day life, or wishing to experience the diplomatic power of flowers, visit the cherry blossoms. Keep in mind some tips! Photographers like to visit the trees with the light of sunrise, when there are (slightly) fewer people around and the city is quiet. Weekends during peak season are really busy! Public transit is recommended over driving. And peak season is getting earlier and earlier each year due to climate change, so keep in mind that preserving the cherry blossoms might be more difficult in years to come.
