> History of cherry blossoms in Washington D.C.:
> - Idea was introduced by a world traveler, Mrs. Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, after her first trip to Japan. Eliza proposed that Japanese cherry trees be planted one day along the reclaimed Potomac waterfront. While her first attempts were ignored, after 24 years, her idea was carried forward by Dr. David Fairchild. In 1908, Fairchild gave cherry saplings to schools in D.C. so that children could plant them in their schoolyard in observance of Arbor Day.
>
> - Eliza Scidmore continued to persist, writing a letter to first lady Helen Herron Taft in 1909. Mrs. Taft had visited Japan and knew of cherry trees and took up the project. After hearing of her plans to plant trees along the avenue of the potomac, the Japanese consul offered a donation of an additional 2,000 trees given in the name of the City of Toyko.
>
> - The planting: In 1912, after an unfortunate mishap with the first shipment of trees, a second shipment of 3,020 from 12 varieties arrived in Seattle from Japan. The trees were planted around the Tidal Basin. This took 7 more years!
>
> - Maybe something here about WWII and the cherry blossoms in DC??
>
> Modern day in Washington D.C.:
> - Bloom watch cam
> - Cherry blossoms bloom each year and draw over a million visitors. They have come to be one of the most distinguishing features of the city. 
> - The cherry blossom festival offers community events and celebrations around the city.
>
> Some flower-peeping tips for your visit:
> - Photographers like to visit the trees with the light of sunrise, when there are (slightly) fewer people around and the city is quiet.
> - Weekends during peak season are really busy! Public transit is recommended over driving
> - Planting originated in 1912 as a gift of friendship
>
> A tribute to stumpy:
> - A beloved cherry blossom, stumpy, came to fame in recent years.
> - Stumpy was removed from the basin in 2024, but will always hold a special place in our hearts.
> - "But itâ€™s not all bad news. Staff from the National Arboretum will take some cuttings from Stumpy and intend to use them to grow new genetic matches (yes, Stumpy clones will be a thing) to help repopulate the Tidal Basin banks once the seawall restoration project is complete. The rest of Stumpy will be turned into mulch to be used on the National Mall" (Cherry Blossom Watch, 2025). 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.
