# Changes made since Part II
After completing Part II, the major of the updates I made focused on the map visualizations and call to action. I receieved helpful feedback about the call to action, which made me realize that the previous version was not specific enough in the call to action. I also realized that tips about tourism would take a lot of time to incorporate, and would be largely repetitive of exisiting (arguably better) resources. So, I instead chose to focus a call to action about specific locations where tourists can see the Cherry Blossoms within D.C. and Japan that I would recommend. This allowed me to make a flow of the maps that "zoomed in" to the specific locations. For the D.C. maps, I filtered the list of Memorials that I showed so that they would be less overwhelming, and would focus on some of the most popular or widely recognizable ones. 

For D.C., I selected the National Arboretum because it's a larger space so it's less cramped than other parts of the city during this busy time, and because it's one of my favorite sites in D.C. For Japan, I relied on internet recommendations. 

I also moved tourism information earlier in the site, as anticipated from Part II. I had originally planned to add a visualization to help the reader wrap their mind around the number of trees (i.e. 38K trees). Instead, I chose to include a copyright-free timelapse video of the tidal basin, which shows the number of tourists moving through a single location in the city. This doesn't necessarily help to visualize the number of trees, but I was hoping it would help to drive home the data about the number of _people_ who are visiting the city. My reasoning for this was that a person may be more motivated to visit if they saw how many other people visit, versus how many trees there are. The number of trees is interesting, but it's not necessarily it's own insight--the statistic helps to explain _why_ so many tourists come to see the trees (i.e. because there are a lot of them!). Plus, humans are socially motivated and the power of FOMO (fear of missing out) is real! 

From a visual perspective, I realized that I could change the size of the maps and graphs to improve the image quality on the site. Then I went through the site to ensure the fonts, colors, and spacing were consistent and cohesive. 

Lastly, I focused on adding footnotes and references to the site, and made sure that there weren't copyright issues with the images. 

## The audience
The audience for this story is individuals who have not had the chance to see the full effect of cherry blossoms (i.e. in full bloom and in volume!)
A more secondary audience could be people who have seen cherry blossoms and enjoyed them, but did not previously know about their history. 

I chose this main audience because I assumed that individuals who had seen the full effect of cherry blossoms would not need convincing, (i.e. they would already want to see them again!)

While the data story could also be useful to anyone planning a trip to Washington D.C. or to Japan, I chose not to focus on the tourism element of the story. There are lots of existing resources with more depth and information than I could pull together in a short time, and I didn't feel the need to recreate those!

# Final thoughts
> _A few other thoughts to share..._

- If I had more time, I would have liked to try another tool or tools for the maps. I found Tableau a bit constraining, and spent a lot of time waiting for the datasets to load. In hindsight, I might have pivoted to a new tooler sooner and had more luck!
- If I had more time, I would have built out a section about the impact of climate change on the Cherry Blossoms. I read a lot about the impact of floods and warmer spring temperatures on the trees, which could have added another interesting angle to the story and made the story feel more complete.
- If I had more time, I would have spent more time on the narrative before I started making the site. I often found myself caught up in the formatting and templates within the tool, which I think took away from time better spent on the story. Also, the design of the site may have come together more quickly if I had been more firm on the story and call-to-action sooner. Next time, I would write it all out in a word document and not move to the site until I was 100% happy with the written version.
- If I had more time, I would have sought more feedback from people in my life. There are lots of fun paths that I could have gone down with this project and didn't get a chance to explore!
- Overall, I'm really glad that I learned how to use Shorthand with this project. The tool is incredibly powerful and looks great. I will definitely keep it in mind for future projects after school, and I bet it will come in handy again in the future! I'm also glad that I picked a 'light' topic that made visuals very easy (because flowers are already nice to look at!) and that made research enjoyable!
