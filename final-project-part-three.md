## The audience
The audience for this story is individuals who have not had the chance to see the full effect of cherry blossoms (i.e. in full bloom and in volume!)
A more secondary audience could be people who have seen cherry blossoms and enjoyed them, but did not previously know about their history. 

I chose this main audience because I assumed that individuals who had seen the full effect of cherry blossoms would not need convincing, (i.e. they would already want to see them again!)

While the data story could also be useful to anyone planning a trip to Washington D.C. or to Japan, I chose not to focus on the tourism element of the story. There are lots of existing resources with more depth and information than I could pull together in a short time, and I didn't feel the need to recreate those!
