# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
- Individuals who haven't visited Washington D.C., or who haven't visited during cherry blossom season
- Individuals who enjoy travel

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask.
- I interviewed colleagues in class

#### Goals
- Assess whether the flow of the story is logical, confusing, and if there are any points that don't fit well or aren't less interesting
  - _Planned Questions:_
    - What do you think the call to action for this story is?
    - What about the story is interesting, boring, exciting?
    - What confused you? Were there parts that were difficult to understand?
- Assess the design choices made (color, presentation methods, data visualizations)
- _Planned Questions:_
    - Did the design flow well? Were there elements that seemed disjoint from the rest of the design?
    - How would you describe the design, color choices, presentation method? Was it fun, casual, formal, etc.?

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

Maybe compared to a national forest?


More data sooner?

| Interviews on 2/17 (with 3 peers) (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| My peers shared a few insights that were really helpful for me and will inform my next project iteration. They also validated many of the design decisions (e.g. colors, layout of the timeline) I made but was originally unsure about, which helped me to be more confident in these decisions. 
- Data visualizations appear later in the story, but maybe could be included sooner / earlier
- It can be difficult to visually quantify some of the numbers used in the story (e.g. how many is 20,000 trees?). The story could be more powerful if this is put into context
- The story could be more tailored to tourists if the idea is introduced sooner and more data provided. |             |             |
