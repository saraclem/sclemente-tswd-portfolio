# Sara Clemente's Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! 

# About me
Welcome! My name is Sara Clemente. This site is a workproduct from my Spring 2025 Graduate course at Carnegie Mellon University. A few things to know about me: 
- I am originally from outside of Boston, MA, but I spent six years living and working in Washington D.C. after college. I've lived in Pittsburgh, PA for two years while attending graduate school.
- I have a dog named Faye, she's the best.
- I have a background in business (operations management) and worked as a consultant and at a govtech startup while in D.C.

# What I hope to learn
From this course, I hope to learn about:
1. New mediums / tools that I can use for impactful presentations
2. Ways to quickly create impactful visualizations
3. How to provide useful and actionable feedback / critiques to colleagues when collaborating on presentations or other projects in the future
